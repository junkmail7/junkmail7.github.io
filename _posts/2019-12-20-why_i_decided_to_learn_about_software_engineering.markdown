I have been interested in tech for a long time. Creating things has always been a passion of mine, from building legos to making music/art. As a child I realized that the video games and programs I used on my computer were another outlet for creativity, as once I learned how to manipulate the enigma of "code" I could be someone who creates these things as well. I was able to go through many high school and college classes on different programming languages, further developing my interest in the field. I now hope to continue down this path and to be able support others with my knowledge I acquire, as well as create programs I am proud of.
